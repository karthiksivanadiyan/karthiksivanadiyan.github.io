        Karthik is a skilled full-stack engineer at the start-up ThreatMaticâ„¢ where he developed security products. He has a particularly keen eye for pixel-perfect user interfaces, while also possessing back-end skillsets relevant to this role: JavaScript/Typescript, SQL, Node.js, React and Svelte. Previously at Walmart, he focused on backend-deliverables in the big-tech ecosystem, learning to deliver at high velocity within a rigid SDLC. Coming from both a start-up and big tech, Karthik can wear multiple hats across product, design, marketing, sales, and engineering. His perfect 4.000 Computer Science Major GPA in college also speaks to his strong technical foundation in object-oriented programing and design concepts.
